# Blue-Fire-Mod-Project

A template project for modding Blue Fire! Contains reflected headers with examples of their functions, variables and events

Headers generated and reflected using [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS/UE4SS) which was made by a bunch of talented people (credited in the README)

Project made with the assistance of Archengius's [UE4ProjectGenerator](https://github.com/Archengius/UE4GameProjectGenerator)

Is not compatible with steam version right away! To do for steam version don't use pak file and change the name of the first folder to the normal Blue Fire

Does not include the Wwise plugin because it was missing a .dll file which caused compilations errors. Also I don't think anybody is going to use wwise in any mods

Happy Modding!
